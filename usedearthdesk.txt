Used Earth ~ I would love to full credit for this new piece of Used Earth, but that wouldn't be fair to my best bud and band member, Roger Davis. We received a rough sketch with some crude measurements and Roger took the lead on this drafting table. Crafted from reclaimed American Walnut and iron. After some finish sanding, I applied a Tung Oil/Varnish finish. Our customer picked his new table up tonight and he seemed to be very pleased. Thank you Roger, this wouldn't have happened if not for you and your God given talent.
