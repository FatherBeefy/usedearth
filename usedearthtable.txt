Used Earth just finished and set up this breakfast room table, chairs, and stools for our friends, Jon and Rachel Dawkins. We put a new patina on their original chairs, a new patina and heart-pine tops on their stools, and we built a new 6 x 4 table top using 150-year-old reclaimed heart pine. We placed it on their original base after adding a matching patina. Jon and Rachel, thanks for the opportunity to re-craft and update your dinette set. Time to make some memories!
