Finished up this Oak Chunk Table today. The 150 year old Oak tree was damaged during an ice storm a couple of years ago in Augusta, Georgia and last summer it was infested with Ambrosia Beetles. The tree died in 3 weeks. My customer had a big chunk saved when it was cut down. For sentimental reasons, she wanted to make something out of the wood, because the tree and property has been in the family for over 100 years. That's where I came in and this is what I came up with. Delivery tomorrow, I hope she approves!
